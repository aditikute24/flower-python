# Flower Python

Welcome to the **Flower Python** project! This project demonstrates how to draw beautiful and colorful flower patterns using Python's `turtle` graphics library. It's a fun and creative way to learn the basics of Python programming while exploring the capabilities of the `turtle` module.

## Features

- **Colorful Flower Patterns**: The project generates various flower designs with vibrant colors.
- **Dynamic and Interactive**: Watch as the flower patterns are drawn step-by-step.
- **Customizable**: Modify the code to create your own unique flower patterns.
- **Educational**: Great for beginners to learn Python and basic programming concepts through visual feedback.

## Demo

To see the flower drawing in action, run the script locally following the steps below.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditikute24/flower-python.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd flower-python
   ```

3. **Install Python**:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. **Run the flower drawing script**:
   ```bash
   python flower.py
   ```

   *Note: The script file name might differ; ensure to run the correct Python file that contains the flower-drawing logic.*

## Usage

- Run the Python script to see the flower pattern being drawn.
- Modify the parameters in the script (such as colors, petal size, and number of petals) to create different flower patterns.
- Experiment with different shapes and colors to create your unique designs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the flower drawing.
- **Turtle Graphics**: A built-in Python library used for drawing shapes and patterns. It is perfect for creating visual effects and learning programming concepts interactively.
